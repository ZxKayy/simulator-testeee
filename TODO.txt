Change ?redistribute default to 'end', #45
If collision are on, randomize initial velocity; if off, wave-like
Pressure model

Histogram base class:
- fixed number of bins
- scale y-axis based on #particles
- horizontal lines to denote vertical scale, increments of 100?
- temporary 'out of range' indicator for x-axis

Energy: Speed histogram
Energy: KE histogram

Intro: hold constant
- None: change N, T, or V => change P
- Volume: change N or T => change P
- Temperature: change N or V => change P
- Pressure T: change N or V => change T
- Pressure V: change N or T => change V

Intro: clean up particle arrays in IdealModel
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN FYI
* I changed the location of the Return Lid button, because container.left is mutable.

DESIGN QUESTIONS (MODEL)
* Problems with pressure model:
  - Why is P = NkT/V yielding a much larger value than Java version?
  - Is our conversion factor to kPa correct?
  - Are values in the Java version correct?
  - Why does Java version use a complicated 'slice' model?
  - How to address the fact that pressure should be zero until particles collide with walls?
