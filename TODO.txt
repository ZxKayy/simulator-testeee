TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT
tone down specular highlight on particles
change particle count to be number in container
understand and document particle-particle collisions
heat/cool

DESIGN
Is initial velocity magnitude based on 300K or the temperature in the box?
Do we need collision detection outside the container? Could particles just float up until they disappear?
Shaded or flat particles?

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'
