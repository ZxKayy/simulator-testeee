Is Java collision detection algorithm, a priori or a posteriori? (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection)

DESIGN
Q: What is the bounds for the collision detection space? Is it dynamic?
A: based on activeBounds of browser window, to left and above container origin.

Q: When are particles removed?
A: When they leave the collision detection space.

Q: Does particle count include all particles that exist, or only those in container?
A: all particles

Q: Does resizing the container have any affect on the collision counter?
A: stops the counter

Q: If particle count is decreased while resizing the container, are particles removed immediately, or queued for removal?
A: Remove immediately, add immediately at initial location (hose connection point)

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size
port Java model
keep gravity, but turn it off

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'
for a fine/coarse control, are fine buttons typically on the inside or outside?
redesign collision counter
simplified icons for stopwatch and collision counter
