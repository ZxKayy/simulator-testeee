TODO list for gas-properties

leftWallVelocity.x is never negative in BaseContainer.step

#62 pump problems: temperature is misbehaving, and one particle gets stuck where it enters the container

Diffusion: #66 When sim is paused, all particles shift back and forth as radius is changed with spinners
Diffusion: Handle divider properly in CollisionDetector.step
Diffusion: alignment of spinners

Intro: hold constant, see HoldConstantEnum

Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Explore: #60 unpause sim when resize handle is moved

Histogram: rewrite, they are a mess

Better names than particle1, particle2, mass1, mass2, etc?

Better approach to fixed-width panels

AP: why do large particles move over each other instead of colliding in Diffusion?

Is this a better collision model?

It seems awfully easy to blow the lid off of the container

Thicker container walls?
