Issue: sample periods, step button
Diffusion: Scale particle radius based on mass
Diffusion: add ?maxInitialNumber

Intro: add jitter to pressure gauge - ask AP what he had in mind
Intro: zero pressure until one particle collides with container

Combine ParticlesNode and DiffusionParticlesNode
Combine Container and DiffusionContainer into 1 class, with optional lid, divider, mutable width
Combine ContainerNode and DiffusionContainerNode into 1 class, with optional lid, divider, mutable width

Intro: hold constant
- None: change N, T, or V => change P
- Volume: change N or T => change P
- Temperature: change N or V => change P
- Pressure T: change N or V => change T
- Pressure V: change N or T => change V

Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Energy: avoid addChild/removeAllChildren in Histogram

DESIGN QUESTIONS (MODEL)
**** What is the model for work done on particles by moving wall?
  https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/19589/simple-question-about-a-gas-in-a-box-with-a-moving-wall
**** What quantities should have a sample period?
**** How should things that have a sample period (e.g. flow rate) behave when user is stepping the model via StepButton?
