TODO list for gas-properties

ComboBoxDisplay is buggy when number initially exceeds range
Factor out ScreenView base class for screens 1-3

Energy: Speed histogram
Energy: KE histogram

Intro: hold constant
Intro: class Lid
Intro: clean up particle arrays in IdealModel
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN FYI
* Sample period for collision counter will not be exact, but should be close enough, see ?log
FINE
* Container size indicator is now the inside dimension
GOOD
* Interaction with resize handle and lid are mutually exclusive; resize handle cancels and disables lid
FINE
* On the speed histogram, I used icons and horizontal layout for the checkboxes
OK
* Confirm that how opening size changes during a drag cycle is as desired.
OK
* Confirm that a simple rectangle is OK for showing previous bounds of the container.
OK
* Confirm that what Average Speed shows for empty container is as desired.
OK
* Choose a value for ?redistribute
LIKES DEFAULT, LEAVE QUERY PARAM
* Choose a value for ?heatCool
MAKE AN ISSUE, ASSIGN TO AR

DESIGN QUESTIONS (MODEL)
* Temperature model is T = (2/3)KE/k, where KE is the average KE of all particles in the container. Java is scale * KE / N.
GOOD
* How to convert temperature to K?
ALREADY IN K
* Is P = NkT/V sufficient for computing pressure? Why does Java version use a complicated 'slice' model?
STICK WITH THIS FOR NOW, NOT SURE ABOUT JAVA VERSION
* How to convert pressure to kPa?
>>>>>>> WE WORKED OUT THE CONVERSION FACTOR, BUT PRESSURE IS WAY TOO LARGE. SHOULD BE ZERO UNTIL PARTICLES HIT WALLS. REVISIT JAVA.
* Is it reasonable to treat the Explore screen like holdConstant=None?
YES
* Is it reasonable to treat the Energy screen like holdConstant=Volume?
YES

DESIGN QUESTIONS (VIEW)
* Describe 'blow lid off' for new lid design. When? How?
START WITH STRAIGHT UP, FULL OPENING IN TOP OF CONTAINER. RETURN LID FULLY CLOSED.
* Why are we showing time to 0.01 ps in the stopwatch? What is the max time?
TO GIVE THE FEELING THAT'S IT'S DOING SOMETHING, 999.99 max is OK.
* "Control Temperature" checkbox doesn't make it clear that we're controlling temperature of particles added. Maybe "Initial Temperature"?
YES "Initial Temperature"
* Why do we need a decimal place for Average Speed?
DROP DECIMAL
* Swap order of bottom 2 'Hold Constant' radio buttons?
OK
* Average Speed display updates like crazy, do we need to smooth this out like the Speed histogram?

* Histograms: bin width, range of axes, scaling of axes, 'data out of range' indicator in Java
VERTICAL SCALE WITH INDICATOR LINES, FIXED NUMBER OF BINS, TEMPORARY OUT OF RANGE INDICATOR
* What is constrainValue for Control Temperature control?
THUMB SNAPS TO 50K INCREMENTS
* Consider making Average Speed an AccordionBox, it won't take any more space, and will provide consistent show/hide
TRY IT
* Consider a different color scheme for controls and panels, there's too much 'black' negative space
WILL DO
* Energy: lid handle collides with Speed accordion box
LEFT EDGE OF HANDLE CONSTRAINED TO LEFT EDGE OF CONTAINER
* What is the max of the pressure gauge?
TBD
* What is the max of the thermometer?
TBD
