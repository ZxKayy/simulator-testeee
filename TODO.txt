TODO list for gas-properties

Histograms: y axis scale
Histograms: rewrite, they are a mess
Histograms: they don't update when particles are added/removed with sim paused

Intro: hold constant, see HoldConstantEnum
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

PUNCH LIST:
CollisionDetector: handle divider properly in CollisionDetector.step
LidAnimation: #64 make it rotate and move left, make it step
EnergyModel: *AverageSpeedProperty vs get*ParticleSpeedValues

REFERENCES
Is this a better collision model?

POLISH
Odd color for divider in projector mode
Odd color for pump radio buttons
Thicker container walls?
