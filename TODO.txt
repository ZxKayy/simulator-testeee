TODO list for gas-properties

Histograms: y axis scale
Histograms: rewrite, they are a mess
Histograms: they don't update when particles are added/removed with sim paused

Intro: hold constant, see HoldConstantEnum
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

PUNCH LIST:
CollisionDetector: handle divider properly in CollisionDetector.step
LidAnimation: #64 make it rotate and move left, make it step

REFERENCES
Is this a better collision model?
