Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays
Intro: pressure - see Java PressureSensingBox.getPressure
Intro: hold constant

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles

Energy: fixed container width
Energy: average speed checkbox and readout
Energy: speed accordion box and histogram
Energy: KE accordion box and histogram
Energy: turn particle collisions on/off
Energy: control temperature of particles that are added

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN
* Temperature on thermometer is T = (2/3)KE/k, where KE is the average KE of all particles in the container
* Sample period for collision counter will not be exact, but should be close enough, see ?log
* Container size indicator is now the inside dimension
* Interaction with resize handle and lid are mutually exclusive; resize handle cancels and disables lid
* Choose a value for ?redistribute
* Choose a value for ?heatCool
* Should opening width be maintained throughout a drag cycle of resize handle?
* Is a simple rectangle OK for showing previous bounds of the container?
* Why are we showing time to 0.01 ps in the stopwatch?
* "Control Temperature" checkbox doesn't make it clear that we're controlling temperature of particles added. Maybe "Initial Temperature"?

Is this a better collision model?
