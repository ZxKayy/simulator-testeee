TODO list for gas-properties

For HoldConstant.PRESSURE_T how should speed of particles be adjusted? T = PV/Nk, |v| = sqrt( 3kT / m )

Get rid of most ES5 getters, they obscure the dynamic nature of some values

Histograms: y axis scale
Histograms: rewrite, they are a mess
Histograms: they don't update when particles are added/removed with sim paused

Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

PUNCH LIST:
CollisionDetector: handle divider properly in CollisionDetector.step
LidAnimation: #64 make it rotate and move left, make it step

Is this a better collision model?

Thicker container walls?
