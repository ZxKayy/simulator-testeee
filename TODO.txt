{IdealModel} fix
const PANEL_WIDTH
Temperature slider thumb should snap to increments of 50K
ComboBoxDisplay is buggy when number initially exceeds range
Factor out ScreenView base class for screens 1-3

Histogram base class: fixed number of bins, scale y-axis based on #particles, horizontal lines to denote vertical scale, temp 'out of range' indicator for x-axis

Energy: Speed histogram
Energy: KE histogram

Intro: hold constant
Intro: blow off lid, straight up, reveal max opening, 'Return Lid' fully closed
Intro: class Lid
Intro: clean up particle arrays in IdealModel
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN QUESTIONS (MODEL)
* Is P = NkT/V sufficient for computing pressure? Why does Java version use a complicated 'slice' model?
STICK WITH THIS FOR NOW, NOT SURE ABOUT JAVA VERSION
* How to convert pressure to kPa?
>>>>>>> WE WORKED OUT THE CONVERSION FACTOR, BUT PRESSURE IS WAY TOO LARGE. SHOULD BE ZERO UNTIL PARTICLES HIT WALLS. REVISIT JAVA.
* What is the max of the pressure gauge?
* What is the max of the thermometer?

DESIGN QUESTIONS (VIEW)
* smoothing of Average Speed display
* "Control Temperature" checkbox doesn't make it clear that we're controlling temperature of particles added. Maybe "Initial Temperature"?
ISSUE?
* Consider a different color scheme for controls and panels, there's too much 'black' negative space
ISSUE?
