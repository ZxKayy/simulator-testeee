Combine Container and DiffusionContainer into 1 class, with optional lid, divider, mutable width
Combine ContainerNode and DiffusionContainerNode into 1 class, with optional lid, divider, mutable width

Diffusion: collision detection and response, with and without divider
Diffusion: Particle Flow Rate vectors

Intro: zero pressure until one particle collides with container
Intro: add jitter to pressure gauge

Intro: hold constant
- None: change N, T, or V => change P
- Volume: change N or T => change P
- Temperature: change N or V => change P
- Pressure T: change N or V => change T
- Pressure V: change N or T => change V

Intro: clean up particle arrays in IdealModel
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Energy: avoid addChild/removeChild in histograms

DESIGN FYI
* I changed the location of the Return Lid button, because container.left is mutable.

DESIGN QUESTIONS (MODEL)

DESIGN QUESTIONS (VIEW)
* Histograms:
  - x-out-of-range indicator
  - when to adjust maxY
  - smoothing
  - bin sizes and number of bins

Is this a better collision model?
