TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT
particles get stuck on (or slide along) inside edges of container
left and top of particles don't touch container, right and bottom of particles overlap container

DESIGN
Is initial velocity magnitude based on 300K or the temperature in the box?
Do we need collision detection outside the container? Could particles just float up until they disappear?

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'
