TODO list for gas-properties

DESIGN
Does resizing the container have any affect on the collision counter? does it need to reset or anything?

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size
port Java model
keep gravity, but turn it off

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'
for a fine/coarse control, are fine buttons typically on the inside or outside?
particle count control: -1, -50, +50, +1 buttons?
redesign collision counter
simplified icons for stopwatch and collision counter

COMMON CODE
PlayPauseButton: rename runningListener to isPlayingListener
StepButton: if you explicitly set enabled = false, then set isPlayingProperty.value = true, StepButton will enable itself
