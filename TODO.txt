#55 Support mutable particle radius in model and view

Combine ParticlesNode and DiffusionParticlesNode, after we determine whether radius is mutable

Intro: hold constant, see HoldConstantEnum

Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Histogram: rewrite to mutate bars/lines, instead of removeAllChildren/addChild on every step
Histogram: don't update when not visible

stringTest

Better names than particle1, particle2, mass1, mass2, etc?

'PV = NkT' vs 'PV = nkT', which to use in doc and code?
