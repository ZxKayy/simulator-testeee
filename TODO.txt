Temperature is wrong when using BicyclePumpNode

5/2/19 design meeting:
#55 Support mutable particle radius in model and view, wire up to Diffusion spinners
#51 use a running average for Particle Flow Rate
#52 add a sample period for histograms, use for Average Speed

Combine ParticlesNode and DiffusionParticlesNode, after we determine whether radius is mutable

Intro: hold constant, see HoldConstantEnum

Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Explore: #60 unpause sim when resize handle is moved

Histogram: rewrite to mutate bars/lines, instead of removeAllChildren/addChild on every step
Histogram: don't update when not visible

stringTest

Better names than particle1, particle2, mass1, mass2, etc?

Is this a better collision model?
