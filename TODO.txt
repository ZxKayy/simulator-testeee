remove color Properties from Particle?
GasPropertiesModel.stepPressure: always call computePressure, to eliminate floating-point issues
#38 split GasPropertiesParticlesNode into 2 instances, for inside and outside container

#78 PRESSURE_T: adjust velocity of particles, animate heat/cool
#71 speed limit for left wall
#64 lid animation
#52 histograms rewrite
#52 histograms y-axis scale
#60 histograms don't update when particles are added/removed with sim paused
