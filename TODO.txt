Hierarchy for ViewProperties
CollisionCounter and CollisionCounterNode should not be present in Energy screen
Fix pressure model, investigate Java implementation

Histogram base class:
- fixed number of bins
- scale y-axis based on #particles
- horizontal lines to denote vertical scale, increments of 100?
- temp 'out of range' indicator for x-axis

Energy: Speed histogram
Energy: KE histogram

Intro: hold constant
Intro: blow off lid, straight up, reveal max opening, 'Return Lid' fully closed
Intro: class Lid
Intro: clean up particle arrays in IdealModel
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN QUESTIONS (MODEL)
* Problems with pressure model:
  - Why is P = NkT/V yielding a much larger value than Java version?
  - Is our conversion factor to kPa correct?
  - Are values in the Java version correct?
  - Why does Java version use a complicated 'slice' model?
  - How to address the fact that pressure should be zero until particles collide with walls?

DESIGN QUESTIONS (VIEW)
* smoothing of Average Speed display
