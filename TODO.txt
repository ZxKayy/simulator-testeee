#50 Intro: zero pressure until one particle collides with container

#55 Support mutable particle radius in model and view

Combine ParticlesNode and DiffusionParticlesNode
Combine Container and DiffusionContainer into 1 class, with optional lid, divider, mutable width
Combine ContainerNode and DiffusionContainerNode into 1 class, with optional lid, divider, mutable width

Intro: hold constant
- None: change N, T, or V => change P
- Volume: change N or T => change P
- Temperature: change N or V => change P
- Pressure T: change N or V => change T
- Pressure V: change N or T => change V

Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Histogram: rewrite to mutate bars/lines, instead of removeAllChildren/addChild on every step
Histogram: don't update when not visible

DESIGN QUESTIONS
What should update when the sim is paused? What should be disabled?
