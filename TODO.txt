TODO list for gas-properties

#78 PRESSURE_T: adjust velocity of particles, animate heat/cool
#71 speed limit for left wall
#64 lid animation

Histograms: y axis scale
Histograms: rewrite, they are a mess
Histograms: they don't update when particles are added/removed with sim paused

PUNCH LIST:
CollisionDetector: handle divider properly in CollisionDetector.step
