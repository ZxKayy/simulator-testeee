TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT

Intro: reimplement lid and handle
Intro: change particle count to be number in container
Intro: particles outside container do not collide, continue up with unchanged velocity
Intro: change regions to cover only inside of container
Intro: pressure - see Java PressureSensingBox.getPressure
Intro: hold constant

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles

Energy: fixed container width
Energy: average speed checkbox and readout
Energy: speed accordion box and histogram
Energy: KE accordion box and histogram
Energy: turn particle collisions on/off
Energy: control temperature of particles that are added

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN
* Temperature on thermometer is T = (2/3)KE/k, where KE is the average KE of all particles
* Heat/Cool is a number from (-1,1), and is used to uniformly scale velocity of each particle by 1 + heatCoolFactor / 1000. How should this behave?
* Why are we showing time to 0.01 ps in the stopwatch?
* "Control Temperature" checkbox doesn't make it clear that we're controlling temperature of particles added. Maybe "Initial Temperature"?
* Sample period for collision counter will not be exact, but should be close enough.

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'

Is this a better collision model?
