TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT
change particle count to be number in container
remove lid
particles outside container do not collide, continue up with unchanged velocity
pressure - see Java PressureSensingBox.getPressure

DESIGN
* Temperature on thermometer is T = (2/3)KE/k, where KE is the average KE of all particles
* Heat/Cool is a number from (-1,1), and is used to uniformly scale velocity of each particle. How should this behave?

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'

REFERENCES
Is this a better collision model?
