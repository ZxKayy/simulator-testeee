TODO list for gas-properties

GasPropertiesModel pressureProperty in core model units, have view convert to kPa

GasPropertiesModel.stepPressure: always call computePressure, to eliminate floating-point issues

#78 PRESSURE_T: adjust velocity of particles, animate heat/cool
#71 speed limit for left wall
#52 histograms rewrite
#52 histograms y-axis scale
#60 histograms don't update when particles are added/removed with sim paused

OPTIONAL
#40 investigate standard collision model

INTERNAL POLISH
remove color Properties from Particle?

PIXEL POLISH
Thicker container walls?
