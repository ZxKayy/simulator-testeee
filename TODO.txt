TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT

Temperature is wrong when using BicyclePumpNode, not a problem in 1.0.0-dev.15

Diffusion: When sim is paused, all particles shift down-right then up-left as radius is changed with spinners

5/2/19 design meeting:
#51 use a running average for Particle Flow Rate
#52 add a sample period for histograms, use for Average Speed

Intro: hold constant, see HoldConstantEnum

Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles, do not redistribute particles

Explore: #60 unpause sim when resize handle is moved

Histogram: rewrite to mutate bars/lines, instead of removeAllChildren/addChild on every step
Histogram: don't update when not visible

stringTest

Better names than particle1, particle2, mass1, mass2, etc?

Is this a better collision model?
