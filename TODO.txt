TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT
tone down specular highlight on particles
change particle count to be number in container
understand and document particle-particle collisions
heat/cool
remove lid
particles outside container do not collide, continue up with unchanged velocity
initial velocity should be based on temperature in container, 300K if container is empty

DESIGN

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'
