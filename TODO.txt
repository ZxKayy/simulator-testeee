TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT
initial velocity should be based on temperature in container, 300K if container is empty
change particle count to be number in container
remove lid
particles outside container do not collide, continue up with unchanged velocity
pressure - see Java PressureSensingBox.getPressure

DESIGN

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'

REFERENCES
Is this a better collision model?
