Intro: class Lid
Intro: clean up particle arrays in IdealModel
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays
Intro: hold constant

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles

Energy: fixed container width
Energy: speed accordion box and histogram
Energy: KE accordion box and histogram
Energy: turn particle collisions on/off, CollisionDetector.particleCollisionsEnabledProperty
Energy: control temperature of particles that are added

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN
* Temperature model is T = (2/3)KE/k, where KE is the average KE of all particles in the container. Java is scale * KE / N.
* How to convert temperature to K?
* Sample period for collision counter will not be exact, but should be close enough, see ?log
* Container size indicator is now the inside dimension
* Interaction with resize handle and lid are mutually exclusive; resize handle cancels and disables lid
* Choose a value for ?redistribute
* Choose a value for ?heatCool
* Should opening width be maintained throughout a drag cycle of resize handle?
* Is a simple rectangle OK for showing previous bounds of the container?
* Why are we showing time to 0.01 ps in the stopwatch?
* "Control Temperature" checkbox doesn't make it clear that we're controlling temperature of particles added. Maybe "Initial Temperature"?
* Describe 'blow lid off' for new lid design. When? How?
* What does Average Speed show when the container is empty?
* Why do we need a decimal place for Average Speed?
* OK to right-align Average Speed?
* On the speed histogram, can we use particle icons instead of 'Heavy' and 'Light', ala Average Speed?
* Is P = NkT/V sufficient for computing pressure? Why does Java version use a complicated 'slice' model?
* How to convert pressure to kPa?
