TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT
understand and document particle-particle collisions
heat/cool

DESIGN

Do we need collision detection outside the container? Could particles just float up until they disappear?

MODEL
Hole in top of container needs to have dynamic size

VIEW
Replace the lid with 'roll back'
