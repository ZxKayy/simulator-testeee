TODO list for gas-properties

UP NEXT

Factor out ScreenView base class for screens 1-3

Energy: Speed histogram
Energy: KE histogram

Intro: hold constant
Intro: class Lid
Intro: clean up particle arrays in IdealModel
Intro: optimize number of iterations over particle arrays

Explore: moving wall does not pause animation and does work on particles

Diffusion: lots of new/different features

DESIGN FYI
* Sample period for collision counter will not be exact, but should be close enough, see ?log
* Container size indicator is now the inside dimension
* Interaction with resize handle and lid are mutually exclusive; resize handle cancels and disables lid
* On the speed histogram, I used icons and horizontal layout for the checkboxes
* Confirm that how opening size changes during a drag cycle is as desired.
* Confirm that a simple rectangle is OK for showing previous bounds of the container.
* Confirm that what Average Speed shows for empty container is as desired.
* Choose a value for ?redistribute
* Choose a value for ?heatCool

DESIGN QUESTIONS (MODEL)
* Temperature model is T = (2/3)KE/k, where KE is the average KE of all particles in the container. Java is scale * KE / N.
* How to convert temperature to K?
* Is P = NkT/V sufficient for computing pressure? Why does Java version use a complicated 'slice' model?
* How to convert pressure to kPa?
* Is it reasonable to treat the Explore screen like holdConstant=None?
* Is it reasonable to treat the Energy screen like holdConstant=Volume?

DESIGN QUESTIONS (VIEW)
* Describe 'blow lid off' for new lid design. When? How?
* Why are we showing time to 0.01 ps in the stopwatch?
* "Control Temperature" checkbox doesn't make it clear that we're controlling temperature of particles added. Maybe "Initial Temperature"?
* Why do we need a decimal place for Average Speed?
* Swap order of bottom 2 'Hold Constant' radio buttons?
* Average Speed display updates like crazy, do we need to smooth this out like the Speed histogram?
* Histograms: bin width, range of axes, scaling of axes, 'data out of range' indicator in Java
* What is constrainValue for Control Temperature control?
* Consider making Average Speed an AccordionBox, it won't take any more space, and will provide consistent show/hide
* Consider a different color scheme for controls and panels, there's too much 'black' negative space
* Energy: lid handle collides with Speed accordion box
